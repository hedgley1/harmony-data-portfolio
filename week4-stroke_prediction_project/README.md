# Exploring Stroke Risk Factors in Stroke Predictor Dataset

## Overview:
This project explores a Stroke Risk Predictor dataset containing patients' demographics and health information to identify which factors may be associated with increased stroke risk. Stroke is a major global health concern, and understanding risk patterns can support prevention and early detection efforts. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization, I examine how variables such as age, gender, BMI, and hypertension relate to stroke outcomes.

## Dataset:
URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

Attributes included: ID, gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, work type, residence type, average glucose levels, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and stroke history

Records: 5110
Columns: 12

## Questions:
1. Is stroke prevelance significantly different between genders?
2. How does stroke prevelance vary across different BMI categories?
3. Is the prevelance of stroke higher among people with hypertension compared to those without it?
4. How does stroke prevelance change with age?
